# Search Algorithms in C

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of various search algorithms in C. Search algorithms are fundamental tools in computer science used to locate specific data within a collection, such as an array. This project includes both simple and advanced search techniques, showcasing their implementation and use cases.

## Included Search Algorithms

### 1. Linear Search
- **Description:** Linear Search is the simplest search algorithm. It checks each element in the array sequentially until the target element is found or the array ends.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Directory:** `LinearSearch`
- **File:** `code.c`

### 2. Binary Search
- **Description:** Binary Search is a more efficient algorithm for searching a sorted array. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval is empty.
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Directory:** `BinarySearch`
- **File:** `code.c`
