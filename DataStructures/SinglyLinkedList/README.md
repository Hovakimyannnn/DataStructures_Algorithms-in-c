# Singly Linked List in C

A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure consisting of nodes that hold data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.


## Overview

A singly linked list is a linear data structure that stores elements in nodes, each pointing to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertion, and deletion of elements without the need for contiguous memory.

## Features

- Create and initialize a linked list.
- Insert elements at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.
- Delete elements from the beginning, end, or a specific position.
- Print all elements in the list.
- Free the memory allocated for the list.

## Getting Started
