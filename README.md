## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are the building blocks of efficient software development. Understanding these concepts is essential for solving complex computational problems and optimizing code performance. This repository provides a collection of implementations, explanations, and use-cases for various data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures

### Arrays
Arrays are a basic data structure that store elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. They allow for efficient access to elements using indices.

### Linked Lists
Linked lists are a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a reference to the next node in the sequence. They are useful for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion operations.

### Stacks
Stacks are a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure where elements are added and removed from the top. They are commonly used for expression evaluation, parsing, and backtracking problems.

### Queues
Queues are a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. They are useful in scheduling, buffering, and breadth-first search algorithms.

### Trees
Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. Common types of trees include binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and B-trees. They are used in database indexing, file systems, and network routing.

### Graphs
Graphs are a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They are used to model relationships and connections in various domains, including social networks, transportation systems, and web page ranking.

### Hash Tables
Hash tables store key-value pairs and provide fast access to data using a hash function. They are widely used in implementing associative arrays, caches, and sets.

### Heaps
Heaps are a special type of binary tree used for efficient priority queue implementation. They are used in algorithms like heapsort and in memory management systems.

### Tries
Tries, also known as prefix trees, are specialized tree structures used for efficient retrieval of strings, especially in applications like autocomplete and spell checking.

## Algorithms

### Sorting
Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a particular order. Common algorithms include quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort, and heapsort.

### Searching
Searching algorithms find specific elements within a data structure. Examples include linear search, binary search, and hash-based search.
